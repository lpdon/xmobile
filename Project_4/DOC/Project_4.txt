Module "EI2C1"     (bean SW_I2C)
   - EI2C1_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the component initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as the SLAVE, 
                this method writes one character (byte) to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code returned, the char is 
                successfully sent to master but the master device responds by an acknowledgement instead of no acknowledgement 
                at the end of transfer. <OnError> event is called in this case.
   - EI2C1_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads one character (byte) from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the component initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads one character (byte) from the bus.
   - EI2C1_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes the block of characters to the bus. If the component is disabled (by the "Disable" method or 
                initialization), the block is moved to the output buffer if the <Output buffer size> property is different from 
                zero. The content of the output buffer is sent immediately with the stop condition at the end when the 
                component is enabled by the "Enable" method. After the output buffer transmission, the whole output buffer is 
                cleared. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization 
                section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a SLAVE, this method writes block of characters to 
                the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is returned, the whole block is successfully sent to a master but the 
                master device responds by an acknowledgement instead of no acknowledgment sent at the end of the last block 
                byte transfer. <OnError> event is called in this case.
   - EI2C1_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads the block of characters from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the 
                "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a 
                SLAVE, this method reads the block of characters from the bus.
   - EI2C1_SelectSlave -When working as a MASTER, this method selects a new slave for communication by its slave address value. 
                Any send or receive method are directed to or from the selected device, until a new slave device is selected by 
                this method. If the selected slave uses 10-bit slave addressing, as the parameter 7 bits must be passed, which 
                involves 10-bit addressing (11110XX), including two MSBs of slave address (XX). The second byte of the 10-bit 
                slave address must be sent to the slave as a general character of send methods. This method is available only 
                if the component is in MASTER mode.
   - EI2C1_GetSelected -When working as a MASTER, this method returns the identification address value of the slave, which is 
                currently selected for communication with the master. If the current slave uses 10-bit slave addressing, the 
                method returns the first 7 bits only, which involves 10-bit addressing (11110XX), including two MSBs of the 
                slave address (XX). This method is not able to return the rest value of 10-bit slave address. This method is 
                available only if the component is in MASTER mode.

Module "CAN1"      (bean FreescaleCAN)
   - CAN1_SetAcceptanceCode -Sets the acceptance code registers. This method writes a code mask directly to the acceptance code 
                registers.
   - CAN1_SetAcceptanceMask -Sets the acceptance mask registers. This method writes an acceptance mask directly to the 
                acceptance mask registers.
   - CAN1_SetAcceptanceMode -Sets the acceptance mode register.
   - CAN1_SendFrame -Sends the frame via the CAN device. Using this method the user can send own message to the CAN bus. This 
                method allows to specify CAN buffer number, message ID, data to be sent and frame type 
                (DATA_FRAME/REMOTE_FRAME).
   - CAN1_ReadFrame -Reads a frame from the CAN device. The user is informed about CAN reception through OnFullRxBuffer event 
                or GetStateRX method.
   - CAN1_GetStateTX -Returns a value of the transmission complete flags.
   - CAN1_GetStateRX -Returns a value of the reception complete flag.
   - CAN1_GetError -Returns the content of the receiver flag register.
   - CAN1_SendFrameExt -Sends a frame. This method automatically selects a free transmit buffer for data transmission. The user 
                cannot specify a transmit buffer.

Module "AD1"       (bean ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels justified to the left. Compared with 
                <GetValue> method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and 
                <AD resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "AS1"       (bean AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read. [ Version specific 
                information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU 
                and the receiver is configured to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then 
                the status of the DMA transfer can be checked using GetCharsInRxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage 
                for details about the communication using DMA.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.  [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 
                derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured

                be checked using GetCharsInTxBuf method. See an example of a typical usage for details about communication 
                using DMA.
   - AS1_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]   DMA mode:

                buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.  [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 
                derivatives ]   DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured 
                to use DMA controller then this method only sets the selected DMA channel. Then the status of the DMA transfer 
                can be checked using GetCharsInTxBuf method. See typical usage for details about communication using DMA.

                defined and the receiver property is enabled. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]  
                DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the receiver is configured to use DMA 
                controller then this method only stops selected DMA channel.
   - AS1_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled. [ Version specific information for Freescale 56800 derivatives ]  
                DMA mode:  If DMA controller is available on the selected CPU and the transmitter is configured to use DMA
