Module "EI2C1"     (bean SW_I2C)
   - EI2C1_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the component initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as the SLAVE, 
                this method writes one character (byte) to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code returned, the char is 
                successfully sent to master but the master device responds by an acknowledgement instead of no acknowledgement 
                at the end of transfer. <OnError> event is called in this case.
   - EI2C1_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads one character (byte) from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the component initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads one character (byte) from the bus.
   - EI2C1_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes the block of characters to the bus. If the component is disabled (by the "Disable" method or 
                initialization), the block is moved to the output buffer if the <Output buffer size> property is different from 
                zero. The content of the output buffer is sent immediately with the stop condition at the end when the 
                component is enabled by the "Enable" method. After the output buffer transmission, the whole output buffer is 
                cleared. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization 
                section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a SLAVE, this method writes block of characters to 
                the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is returned, the whole block is successfully sent to a master but the 
                master device responds by an acknowledgement instead of no acknowledgment sent at the end of the last block 
                byte transfer. <OnError> event is called in this case.
   - EI2C1_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads the block of characters from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the 
                "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization section of <Slave address init> property. When working as a 
                SLAVE, this method reads the block of characters from the bus.
   - EI2C1_SendStop -When working as a MASTER, if the <Automatic stop condition> property value is 'no', this method sends a 
                valid stop condition to the serial data line of the I2C bus to terminate the communication on the bus after 
                using send methods. This method is enabled only if the component is in MASTER mode and <Automatic stop 
                condition> property value is 'no'
   - EI2C1_SelectSlave -When working as a MASTER, this method selects a new slave for communication by its slave address value. 
                Any send or receive method are directed to or from the selected device, until a new slave device is selected by 
                this method. If the selected slave uses 10-bit slave addressing, as the parameter 7 bits must be passed, which 
                involves 10-bit addressing (11110XX), including two MSBs of slave address (XX). The second byte of the 10-bit 
                slave address must be sent to the slave as a general character of send methods. This method is available only 
                if the component is in MASTER mode.
   - EI2C1_GetSelected -When working as a MASTER, this method returns the identification address value of the slave, which is 
                currently selected for communication with the master. If the current slave uses 10-bit slave addressing, the 
                method returns the first 7 bits only, which involves 10-bit addressing (11110XX), including two MSBs of the 
                slave address (XX). This method is not able to return the rest value of 10-bit slave address. This method is 
                available only if the component is in MASTER mode.

Module "PWM6"      (bean PWM)
   - PWM6_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FFFF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer possibilities and on 
                the selected period.
   - PWM6_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - PWM6_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

Module "PWM7"      (bean PWM)
   - PWM7_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FFFF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer possibilities and on 
                the selected period.
   - PWM7_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - PWM7_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.

Module "AD1"       (bean ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels justified to the left. Compared with 
                <GetValue> method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and 
                <AD resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "Cpu"       (bean MC9S12C32_48)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Set low power mode - Wait mode.  For more information about the wait mode see documentation of this CPU.  
                Release from Wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Set low power mode - Stop mode.  For more information about the stop mode see documentation of this CPU.
